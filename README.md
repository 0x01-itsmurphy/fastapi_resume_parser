Sure, here's a basic README for running a FastAPI application:

# FastAPI Application

## Introduction

This is a basic FastAPI application. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, you can use the command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Here, `main` should be the name of your Python file (i.e., `main.py`), and `app` is the name of the FastAPI instance in that Python file.

The `--reload` flag enables hot reloading, which means the server will automatically update whenever you make changes to your code.

## Accessing the Application

Once the server is running, you can access the application at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

You can also access the automatic interactive API documentation at:

```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## Conclusion

That's it! You now have your FastAPI application up and running. Enjoy coding!

Please replace the placeholders with your actual file names and variables. If you have any issues, feel free to ask for help. Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
